# Kaleidos

[Kaleidos](https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/beleid-en-regelgeving/werking-en-besluitvorming-vlaamse-regering/kaleidos) is a software-platform used to support the decision-making-process of the Flemish government. The main software-stack is built upon [semantic.works](https://semantic.works/), a micro-service-based, [linked-data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data)-first architecture (previously known as [mu.semte.ch](https://mu.semte.ch/)). This repository contains the necessary configuration for each service that the stack is composed of. Please refer to the documentation of [mu-project](https://github.com/mu-semtech/mu-project/#mu-project) for more information on how to run and configure *semantic.works*-based project.
